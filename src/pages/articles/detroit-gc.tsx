            Get ready for a birdie fest in Michigan. The winning scores here at Detroit GC in the 6 years they have played here have been -23, -25, -18, -26, -24, and 18. The course lengthened a tad after the first two showings, but clearly the issue isn't the length. The rough is short, the course is very "cuttable", and there isn't much bite. It ranks as the 9th easiest course on Tour this season, the 8th easiest when measuring fairways hit, and only has 2 hazards on the entire course. The rough is being reported as "thicker" this year, but we know how that goes. For 90% of tour spots it is spotty at best and unless there is a serious dedication to it like Oakmont it will not have much effect. There has been very little rain, and there isn't much in the forecast either. This does give us hope for a little bit of defense, as this will be the first year Detroit is not soaked heading into the event.

            SGOTT in year 1 wasn't a factor at all, with only 1 of the top gained SGOTT players in that tournament recording a top 20. However, in year 2 there was a massive change. Of the top 16 players when measuring SGOTT in 2020, all of them finished inside the top 30. Bryson dominated off the tee the year he won, which made it clear that the bomb and gouge technique is the way to go here. Tony Finau gained 5.8 SGOTT in 2022 on his way to victory, which ranked 2nd overall. The runner up Cam Young gained 5.3 SGOTT which marked 3rd overall that week. In 2023 we saw a switch back to SGAPP, as Rickie, Collin, and Hadwin all ranked in the top 10 when measuring SGAPP, and every player who finished 5th or better ranked in the top 10 when measuring SGAPP for the tournament. Cam Davis was a complete outlier last season. He did not rank in the top 5 when measuring SGAPP or SGOTT, but dominated SGPUTT and SGARG. This is not the norm for any tournament.

            The Rocket Mortgage is held on the North Course at Detroit Golf Club. Detroit GC is the oldest on Tour rotation, with the North Course being opened in 1916. This par 72 track is designed by Donald Ross, and like we mentioned before, is wide open. It is a classical parkland style that is tree lined, but with the fairways being the 6th widest on Tour, this rarely comes into play. This is one of the most generous courses off the tee, with fairways averaging 36 yards wide (10th narrowest on Tour).

              <span className="font-bold">BEN GRIFFIN:</span> A top play in our model this week. If you have been paying attention to the PGA Tour you know what kind of break out season this Ben is having. But forget the results, look at his metrics in the last 36 rounds played:

              <li>25 strokes gained on approach</li>

              He has been an elite ball striker, and the distance gained has not gone unnoticed. He was quoted at the Memorial crediting his added length to his success, talking about how he used to hit 6i or 7i with his approach on that par 4 18th. This yearâ€¦ sand wedge.

              The added distance will go a long way (pardon the pun) at Detroit Golf Club. We already discussed how the driver off the box usage will be over 80%, AND how it has gotten torn apart by bombers in the past. With a firm course we expect the distance to mean even more this week. We have him as the favorite, so there is mega value at the 22/1 range.

    <h1>John Deere Classic Betting Mega Preview</h1>
    <p>Fresh off a 100/1 outright winner, we roll into TPC Deere Run looking for our third straight winner. If you're betting or building DFS lineups this week, here's the full breakdown you need.</p>
    <h2>Scoring Environment: Low. Very Low.</h2>
    <p>TPC Deere Run is a certified birdie fest — and has been for years.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Last 6 winning scores: All -20 or better</li>
      <li>Davis Thompson ran away with it last year at -28</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Expect another shootout — and don't waste time looking for grinders</p>
    <h2>Course Setup & Key Metrics</h2>
    <p>TPC Deere Run ranks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>8th easiest course in SG: Approach overall</li>
      <li>6th easiest when filtering for approach shots under 150 yards</li>
      <li>4th lowest scoring average over the past 5 seasons</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a wedge-heavy track where shorter hitters are live. Most second shots will be inside 150 yards, and the scoring holes are bunched in the Par 4 400–450 yard range.</p>
    <h3>Hole Distribution:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Par 4 (400–450): 6 holes</li>
      <li>4 of those 6 average under 3.91 strokes</li>
      <li>That zone alone holds 11% weight in our base model</li>
      <li>If your player can't score there, they're behind.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Shot Type & Strategy</h2>
    <p>While the course is easy statistically, it's not brainless.</p>
    <p>Sloping fairways, forced layups, and elevation changes force players to use every club in the bag. That's why we built our AI Caddie Proximity Model tailored specifically for Deere Run. It maps where players will attack from — and filters out who's most equipped to take advantage.</p>
    <h2>Course Stats vs Tour Averages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>GIR% — PGAT Avg: 64.4% | TPC Deere Run: 72.1%</li>
      <li>Driving Accuracy — PGAT Avg: 61.2% | TPC Deere Run: 72.9%</li>
      <li>Scrambling % — PGAT Avg: 56% | TPC Deere Run: 61%</li>
      <li>3-Putt/Round — PGAT Avg: 0.571 | TPC Deere Run: 0.41</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There's no penalty for missing fairways, and greens are easy to hit and hold. This means birdies — and lots of them. Birdie or Better Gained (BoB) has been highly predictive in recent years.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Last year's winner (Thompson) and runner-up (Straka) were both top 15 in BoB gained over their last 24 rounds entering the week.</p>
    <h2>DFS & Outright Strategy</h2>
    <p>With 14 players priced between 25/1 and 35/1, this is a great week to be aggressive in One-and-Done or take some shots in DFS. Ownership should be spread out, not condensed like a major.</p>
    <p>Our current OAD pool position:<br />
    110th and 700th out of 3,702<br />
    We're rolling with Davis Thompson (again) and Ben Griffin</p>
    <p>Both rate highly in wedge proximity and BoB scoring.</p>
    <h2>Market Outlook</h2>
    <p>This isn't a week to sit out just because the field lacks star power.</p>
    <p>In fact, these are the weeks where models matter most. The public overlooks them. Books miss price movement. DFS ownership projections get soft.</p>
    <p>The market is exploitable.</p>
